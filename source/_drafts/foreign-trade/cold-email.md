如何写一封能收到回复的开发信？

<!-- more -->


## 原则

- 用公司的企业邮箱或国外邮箱（Outlook、Gmail……）
- 发邮件的时间选在客户当地的上班时间（借助定时发送功能）
- 第一次联系客人的时候使用纯文本格式，不要出现图片、链接和附件（以防被 Spam）
- 注意专有名词的写法，发送之前检查一遍错别字和语法
- 使用英文标点符号，并在后面空一格（括号首位空一格）
- 不要高估客户的英文水平，拒绝「秀英文」，把复杂的东西用最简单的文字表达出来。



## 假设

- `TingTalk Co,. Ltd.` 我的公司，卖番茄（Tomato）的。
- `MyLife Inc.` 我的（My）老客户，美国第二大番茄零售商。
- `NewLife Inc.` 潜在的新（New）客户。



## Subject

- 主题（Subject）有新意



`NewLife Inc. / MyLife Inc. Vendor - Tomato / TingTalk Co,. Ltd.`

- `NewLife Inc.` 提及潜在客户的公司名，表示这不是群发邮件。
- `MyLife Inc. Vendor - Tomato` 表明我们是美国第二大番茄零售商的供应商。
- `TingTalk Co,. Ltd.` 表明发件人是谁。



**到客户网站上找素材**

- 假设标语 / 核心价值 / 总裁致辞是 `Secure Your Daily Work`。标题可以是: Secure Your Daily Work, can we involve?  

**以客户利益为目标，越具体越好**

- Customer Inc - Economy safety products get revenue 20% up - TingTalk Co,. Ltd.

**以主打产品为标题，一目了然**

- Purchasing - Featured products / Safetyvests - TingTalk Co,. Ltd.

**以市场信息为标题**

- TingTalk Co,. Ltd.: Nonwoven material rise in April

**直接表明意图**

- How could we be your possible vendor - TingTalk Co,. Ltd.

**其他**

- To ABC company/professional rugged solution provider/supplier of xxx

## 正文

### 内容

- 内容简洁明了，客户处理邮件的时间可能只有 3 秒钟：`We supply tomatoes for MyLife Inc. with high quality and competitive price. Hope to cooperate with you!`
- 从哪里得到客户的信息
- 我是谁，来自哪个公司
- 公司是做什么产品的（针对客人用得上的产品）
- 产品参数
- 产品的优势：专利、证书或者畅销的市场
- 合作过的大客户：供货能力和质量以及信誉上没问题
- 设计开发能力：能够满足他们的需求
- 诉求处理速度：表明合作有效率
- 交货时间以及付款方式
- 新客户的优惠以及能够给予哪些支持

###  语气



**语气委婉**

- Could you please help to give me a reply today?

**多用被动语态**

- ❌主动语态：We'll send you the samples tomorrow.
- ✔️被动语态：Samples will be sent to you tomorrow.


被动语态侧重的是既定的事实和一些已经达成的决定，是用来突出特点，表现专业性的。

主动语态呢，就是用来释放情感，展示温度的，比如说写延期邮件的时候，用主动语态才更能体现出你的歉意和真诚。

### 排版

- 不用 [非衬线体（ sans-serif ）](https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E6%97%A0%E8%A1%AC%E7%BA%BF%E4%BD%93)：例如 Arial。
- 不要花花绿绿，只留黑色（加粗），灰色（正文）和品牌色。

- CAPITAL（大写）或**加粗**显示需要强调的信息
  
  > LARGEST BUYER of Smartphone


- 使用列表（Ordered List or Unordered List）陈述 3 到 6 个 USP（Unique Selling Point）
  > - TWO SWAROVSKI LICENCES.
  > - Jewelleries made with Swarovski crystals, sterling silver 925, zirconia and pearl.
  > - More than 120 new arrivals monthly, as well as 15,000 available designs.
  > - NO nickle, lead and cadmium (REACH No. 1907/2006)

## 案例

Hi `***`,  

Samples received and already passed to factory. The material was PP, not ABS. 

Offer sheet is preparing and will be sent to you soon.

By the way, raw material increased these days. Please make a decision quickly to go ahead after price confirmed. We'll arrange the mass production asap.

Thanks and best regards,
Tim





## 谈判

### 技巧

我卖一个灯的产品，客人很喜欢，外型材料亮度都觉得不错，但是 3.5 美元的价格他觉得太贵了，他希望 2.5 美元左右，他能接受。这个时候我会告诉客人，这个价格相当困难，外壳塑料要用 PP 代替 ABS，另外 LED 用差一点的，亮度从 12000MCD 改成 5000MCD，另外节省一切材料，把东西做轻做薄，彩盒包装改成白盒，而且是一层纸的最软的那种。外箱同样用比较烂的。就可以达到目标价了。这个时候就是谈判的关键，你把上述条件全部列出来，然后告诉客人，这就是基于您的目标价，我们能给出的方案。我明白，价格尽管达到了，但是品质肯定离您的要求比较远，那么这样，我再给出第三套方案，在一和二里面折中一下，把价格控制在 3.5 美元和 2.5 美元之间，比如 3 美元或者 2.98 美元，让客人比较容易接受。

## Differences

### Packaging vs Packing

**Packaging**

- 产品的包装：彩盒包装、气泡袋包装……


**Packing**
- 打包：有多少箱，每箱多少件。所以装箱单的英文是 Packing list


### Supplier vs Vendor


**Supplier**
- A supplier may be the manufacturer of goods
- A supplier is mostly a middleman who supplies goods or services to the vendor


**Vendor**
- A vendor sells the goods to the consumer and is the last person involved in the supply chain.
- A vendor is rarely a manufacturer
