如何写一封能收到回复的开发信？

<!-- more -->

I received my order yesterday and found the items intact. I would like to thank you for that. 

And as feedback, I would like to mention that it would be better if you can educate the customers about the duty and tariff rates that may be applying to your products. So they can be prepared for what's coming. They would be surprised as I did. For your information, I was charged 45% of the total invoice as customs duty and other taxes. 

I hope my feedback will help you in growing your market in Sri Lanka. Other than that it has been great pleasure doing business with you and hopes to continue this trade relationship in the future as well. Have a nice weekend.
