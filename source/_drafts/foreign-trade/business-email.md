## Get In Touch In The Future

> Dear Tim,

> thank you for responding to my RFQ. Unfortunately the price is far too high for me compared with the other suppliers. But at least I wanted to let you know, that your response is the most professional one, that I have received.
>
> Your offer sheet shows that you understood my need perfectly. 
>
> So thank you for this and we might get in touch for another product in the future.
>
> Best regards,
>
> Frank
