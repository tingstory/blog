 You Are the Apple of My Eye.  You Are the Sunshine of My Life. 

<!-- more -->



I said goodbye to my girlfriend because I couldn't handle a long-distance relationship.



When I ended our relationship in September 2016.



I hope we could part on good terms. So I said "珍重".



Breaking up is hard for me. I have never broken up with anyone before. Blue fish was my first love. I thought we would be together forever. 



We haven't been happy together since 2014, so we broke up many times during 2014 to 2016.



because of irreconcilable differences in values.



Now I can focus more on who I am.



You know, it has been lonely since the breakup.



I always tell my friend, "I am done with Blue Fish. Don't mention her name anymore."

## Get Her Back

I am still trying to get my ex-girlfriend back, I just can't forget her.
